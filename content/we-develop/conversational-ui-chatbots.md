## Rise of the Bots
Messaging apps have become ubiquitous and claim higher engagement with more monthly active users than the big four social networks.  Frequently hyped as an answer to app fatigue, chatbots do not require your users to install a new app, and are often cheaper to build than traditional mobile applications.  

## Chatbot development
We have experience developing bots for all the major messaging platforms including <strong>Facebook Messenger</strong>, <strong>Slack</strong>, <strong>SMS</strong>, and voice interfaces such as <strong>Amazon Alexa</strong>.  We can help you understand whether a conversational or menu-driven approach is right for your use case, how to design conversations, and how to apply AI and natural language processing technology.
