Are you looking for an opportunity to show what you’re capable of?  Feeling stuck in an organisation where you don’t have space to develop yourself?  We’re looking for someone who wants to be fast-tracked into a more senior position that would involve leading development on multiple projects, managing and mentoring junior developers and taking an active role in influencing the company’s strategy.

We’re a small company that builds digital products for a range of clients including Turner Broadcasting, UEFA, NHS, Bank of England.  As well as having top-tier clients, we build our own SaaS products and release open source projects.  We’re a cross between a consultancy and a start-up.

You must have really sharp analytical and communication skills, with an excellent working knowledge of Drupal 7 as this is the platform you will be dealing with initially in the first 6 months.  We work with a whole range of technologies and so ideally you will have some experience with node.js, python, and standard front-end libraries in order to pitch in on other projects.  We use a range of data stores including postgres, redis, solr, elasticsearch, and we’ve built machine-learning projects using Apache Spark and Scala.  We're currently interested in conversational UIs and employing Natural Language Processing techniques. Our tech stack is always evolving.

We don’t expect long hours, but we do expect you to be able to manage your time well and take responsibility for getting things done.  We’re a friendly, social team based in a spacious office in Shoreditch (obviously).  You’ll have access to all the tools you need and we encourage you to scale yourself.  We have a generous bonus scheme to reward performance which you'll automatically be enrolled into after six months.  As a company we’re going through an exciting period of change and so this is the perfect opportunity for someone who really wants to step up and see what they can accomplish.

### Requirements
- Drupal 7 - custom module development
- Ideally experience with modern front-end frameworks (e.g. Angular, React )
- Ideally Node.js or Python experience (bonus if both)
- Excellent communication and problem solving abilities
- Good sense of humour!
- Able to work in London

### Salary
- Starting at £35-40k plus bonus.

### Apply
Please email our CTO ([john@atchai.com](mailto:john@atchai.com)) and let us know what interests you about the opportunity.  Please provide some examples of your work (ideally a github link) and CV (linkedin link is fine).  If  there's a fit then we'll set up a time to meet to get to know each other better.
