Today’s data publishing hubs are predominantly document management systems which publish spreadsheets. Data publishing hubs of the future will help us understand the meaning of data, link related data and provide advanced visualisations and analysis tools. 

Dataseed offers a simple way to create multi-dimensional interactive visualisations. It's takes just a few minutes to import a spreadsheet before we present you with a visualisation, allowing you to instantly start exploring your data with clickable charts. 

An API is provided so that you can update your data in real-time.  We can handle millions of rows, and we use in-memory technology to aggregate data before it is sent to the browser.

We respect Tufte’s principles of information design - there’s no chartjunk, and a high data-to-ink ratio. 

The front-end of Dataseed is [open-source](https://github.com/dataseed/dataseed-visualisation) so that you have full control over the appearance of your visualisations. There is also a [Drupal module](https://drupal.org/project/dataseed) to enable rapid integration with the Drupal CMS.
