We redeveloped Easyhealth's site in Drupal 7, with a strong focus on accessibility for the audience, composed primarily of people with learning difficulties.

## What the client says

> We were impressed with Atchai’s approach from the beginning interview.
> 
> John, Atchai's principal consultant, was quick to understand our spec, the need of our clients and our ethos as a charity. It became apparent very quickly that John had extensive experience and skills, but at the same time John came across as being very down to earth and approachable.
> 
> This initial impression continued throughout our working relationship. John was easy to access by phone or email whenever there was ever anything that we didn’t understand or had to talk through. He managed our relationship with patience, thoughtfulness and efficiency, ensuring all the target deadlines were met as agreed.
> 
> We had a strong and effective working relationship with John in which he helped us to work creatively and to get the most out of our budget. From set up, through to delivery, launch and closure, John was reliable, professional, thoughtful and inspiring.
> 
> We highly, highly recommend Atchai.
