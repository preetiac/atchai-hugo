Exciting news! Our work on [Turner Broadcasting's General Entertainment](portfolio/turner-broadcasting-general-entertainment) multi-site has been included in Drupal.org's [featured sites showcase](http://drupal.org/node/1670774). This includes a feature on the [home page](http://drupal.org).

Thank you drupal.org editors, and thanks to everybody who worked on the project and helped make it such a success.
