## Messenger app user numbers are expected to outgrow that of social media apps in the next few years and conversational UI has become a red-hot topic.  

## Enter chat-bots.
<br>

It’s [reported](http://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696477-market-apps-maturing-now-one-text-based-services-or-chatbots-looks-poised) that over 2.5 billion people have at least one messaging app installed. **By 2018, Activate [Forecasts](http://www.slideshare.net/ActivateInc/activate-tech-and-media-outlook-2016/7-Because_attention_is_highly_multitasked) that number to grow to 3.6 billion people.**

In this article, we will examine the most popular messaging apps, and pull together all available information on users, features, and chat-bot friendliness.

#### [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/)

WhatsApp is an instant messaging platform for smartphones and desktop. Users can send text messages, documents, images, video, user location and audio messages to other users. Users can also make VoIP calls using the platform. It was founded in 2009 and was acquired by Facebook in February 2014.

> In February 2016, WhatsApp reported that it had a **user base of** [1 billion](https://blog.whatsapp.com/616/One-billion). 

It is **used in [109 countries](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/whatsapp-in-over-109-countries-with-70-million-users-in-india-study-841858)**, or 55.6% of the world**, and supports more than 50 languages.

WhatsApp has been slow to open itself up to businesses. In January 2016 it announced that it will [start testing
tools](http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/01/18/whatsapp-businesses-free-1-billion/#b1caeab6bd11) this year to allow its users to communicate directly with businesses and organisations.

![Facebook Messenger Logo](/images/Facebook_Messenger_logo.jpg)

#### [Facebook Messenger](https://en-gb.messenger.com/)

In 2016, an estimated **[50.5% of UK residents](http://www.emarketer.com/Article/More-Than-Half-of-UK-Population-Will-Log-on-Facebook-This-Year/1013627) (33.2 million users)** will log on to Facebook each month. **[50.3% of Americans](http://www.emarketer.com/Article/This-Year-More-Than-Half-of-Americans-Will-Use-Facebook/1013560)** of all ages will be on Facebook at least once a month, up from 49.3% in 2015. 

Globally it is the most popular social network with **1.65 billion users of which [566 million users are in Asia
Pacific](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/social-media/facebook-nears-150-million-users-in-india-dan-neary/article8673625.ece).** In its second quarter 2016 earnings Facebook reported that it now has **[1.57 billion monthly active users. It was also reported that it has 1.13 billion daily active users](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2016/Facebook-Reports-Second-Quarter-2016-Results.pdf)**. 

> It was recently reported that Facebook Messenger now has [1 billion active users](http://www.recode.net/2016/7/20/12232130/facebook-messenger-one-billion-users). Messenger [added 100 million](http://www.recode.net/2016/7/20/12232130/facebook-messenger-one-billion-users) new users in the last three months and about the same for the period January 2016 to March 2016, indicating fairly steady growth.

In it’s first quarter earnings report Facebook announced that **on average its users spend about [50 minutes per day
across](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html?_r=0) it’s apps (Facebook, Instagram and Facebook Messenger)**. At first glance this may not seem like a lot, but consider that there are only 24 hours in a day and the average person sleeps about 8.8 hours per day. 

> The average Facebook user spends roughly 5% of their waking hours across its apps!

Facebook Messenger was [first launched in August 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Messenger). In April 2014 it was announced that the messaging functionality will be completely removed from Facebook and users will be forced to download Messenger. Although users were unhappy about this at the time, it doesn’t seem to have slowed down the app’s growth (see above). Originally released to enable users to easily reach friends wherever they are the app has added a host of features to extend its use from purely social to a lifestyle app.

> [In 2015 a stack of new features](https://contently.com/strategist/2016/01/08/800-million-users-could-messenger-become-bigger-facebook/) were introduced meaning users spend even more time in the app: send & receive money, virtual business cards, transportation platform, business on messenger, message requests and [M](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/facebook-launches-m-new-kind-virtual-assistant/) to name a few.

In April 2016 Facebook announced the launch of its [bot platform](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2016/04/12/bots-for-messenger/) for Messenger. In the first three months since the launch, [more than 11,000 bots](http://venturebeat.com/2016/06/30/facebook-messenger-now-has-11000-chatbots-for-you-to-try/) have been built.

users. In April 2016 it was reported to have [300 million active users](http://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/).

Skype is used globally for social and business communication, as well as initiatives like [Skype in the classroom](https://education.microsoft.com/skypeintheclassroom) (launched in 2009)which **has over 1.5 million educators from around the world bringing real-life learning to over 6 million students**. 

> At the end of 2015 Skype reported that its users spent [3 billion minutes](http://blogs.skype.com/2015/12/17/2015-skypes-year-in-review/) on Skype calls each day.

Microsoft is turning Skype into a messaging platform. In March 2016, [it introduced the Skype Bot Program](http://qz.com/651098/microsoft-is-turning-skype-into-a-messaging-platform-and-as-usual-its-late-to-the-game/), a set of tools that lets developers build bots for Skype.

![Telegram Logo](/images/Telegram_logo.jpg)

#### [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)

Telegram is a could-based instant messaging platform that can be used on mobile and desktop systems. Its users can send messages and exchange photos, videos, stickers and files of any type. It was launched in 2013 in Russia and in February 2016 it [announced that is had 100 million monthly active users](https://telegram.org/blog/100-million) with 35,000 new users signing up each day.

Telegram doesn’t collect user data and so not much is known about its user demographics. Business of Apps reported in January 2016 that its users are [most interested in money transfer features](http://www.businessofapps.com/telegram-statistics-and-revenue/) on their mobile messaging apps.

Telegram is used by individuals and businesses. It focuses on speed and security, can be used on multiple devices at the same time and has stated that it will remain free for ever. It also **supports group chats with up to 5000 members per group**.

#### And the next few years…

As stated at above, the number of people that have at least one messaging app installed is expected to grow to 3.6 billion by 2018. Put another way, that is a staggering **90% of the worlds internet enabled population** or nearly half the estimated world population ([7.56 billion](http://www.geohive.com/earth/his_history3.aspx))!

It’s a huge audience pool and services based on artificial intelligence is improving rapidly. With businesses looking for new ways to engage with users, chat-bots have become a very attractive option. Some are even asking whether chat-bots could be the [fifth wave of internet communication](http://www.vertoanalytics.com/chatbots-fifth-wave-internet-communications/)?

#### So how do I choose the most suitable platform?
<br>

**Choose the platform based on your use case.**

It’s possible to create cross-platform products using libraries like [Botkit](https://howdy.ai/botkit/), Telegram Bot API, Microsoft Bot framework, Facebook Bot Engine, API.ai etc. 

However — establish who your user base is that you want to reach, how you need to reach them and pick the platform best suited for your specific requirements. A focussed approach means you build faster, learn faster and ultimately deliver
better results faster.

There are numerous bot-builder products out there. These products make it simple to create a very basic bot, but you will run into their limitations quickly. Working with a professional chat-bot consultancy to identify the right platform and framework will save you a lot of time, money and pain overall.
