**UPDATE:  Out of 736 applications, it was announced today that we are one of the 22 winners to receive funding from [#innovateAfrica](http://innovateafrica.fund).  We're absolutely thrilled to have been chosen, and we're really excited about the potential for Eyewitness to transform newsgathering.**

## What is EyeWitness Bot?

Eyewitness will allow media organisations to leverage their community on Facebook to gather opinions, tip-offs and quotes.  We will save journalists time, enabling them to collect information quickly and on a large scale, with an innovative AI bot and data analysis platform.

Journalists can construct surveys and engage in long-term research projects, delivered to their audience through Facebook Messenger - the most popular messaging app in the world alongside WhatsApp.

Eyewitness delivers surveys as a conversation, adapting the questions asked based on the answers received, resulting in a more human and engaging experience than a traditional web form.  It will also be possible to use photos, videos and other media as part of the conversation.

Journalists will be able to quickly sort and aggregate responses in order to see trends and find interesting stories to follow up for more information and verification.

Initially we’re partnering with [The Star in Kenya](http://www.the-star.co.ke/) and [Punch in Nigeria](http://punchng.com/) but get in touch if you'd like to work with us. We’re really excited about the potential for Eyewitness to transform newsgathering.
