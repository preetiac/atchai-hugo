We're thrilled that our [Dataseed visualisation](http://getdataseed.com/visualise/mortality) of UK mortality statistics has been featured on the [Guardian Datablog](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011).

[Dataseed](https://getdataseed.com/) is our sister company, specialising in data visualisation, and currently working towards a beta version of an open platform that will allow anyone to upload spreadsheets of data and get [beautiful, interactive browser-based visualisations](https://dataseedapp.com/visualise/4be3ede3c2284ef6b7060cc3c200b22e/1) in return.
